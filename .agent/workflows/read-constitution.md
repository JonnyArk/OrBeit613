# Initialize: Read the Constitution

Before writing any code, you MUST internalize the project's supreme governing document.

## Steps

1. Read the Constitution:
```
ORBEIT_CONSTITUTION.md
```
Located at the project root: `/Users/tekhletvault/OrBeit AG Build/ORBEIT_CONSTITUTION.md`

2. Read the Workspace Rules:
```
.agent/rules/workspace.md
```

3. Confirm you understand:
   - **Privacy is Law** — Zero-Knowledge Architecture, no user data on cloud
   - **Bereshit Protocol** — 7-day folder structure (`lib/src/day1_or` through `day7_shabbat`)
   - **Springfield Model** — Spatial graph with Nodes, Relationships, Proximity
   - **Tech Stack** — Flutter + Drift + SQLCipher + Flame + Riverpod + Gemini
   - **Moral Engine** — Steward not servant, just scales, Sabbath mode
   - **Single Workspace** — Only work in `/Users/tekhletvault/OrBeit AG Build/`

4. Only THEN proceed with any coding task.
